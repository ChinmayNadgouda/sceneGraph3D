Steps:

1) Run the file utils_chinmay/createTxtForPointNet.py, to get .txt files suitable for PointNet++ for that ensure labelmaker ARKIT scenes (labelmaker_home) are present in the correct folder and scenfun3d scenes are also correctly present (scenefun_home).  Make sure the save path is present (save_path)
	To get train test val splits run the script: check_train_test_list.py
2) Run the file creatNpyFilesForMask3D.py, to get .npy files suitable for Mask3D ( Make sure the text files generated from above step are in correct path (text_files_home), (folder_path) represents the path for scenefun3d files)
3) Run the file mask3d_create_label_database.py, to generate metadata (GT, ymal) for Mask3D
4) Run the file use_eval.py to test the Mask3D checkpoint on own data.  (edit the checkpoint_path in eval.py main method)
